# Ver-o-Preço --- Supabase Architecture

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how Supabase is used as the backend platform for
Ver-o-Preço.

Supabase provides:

- Authentication.
- PostgreSQL.
- Storage.
- Realtime.
- Row Level Security.

The frontend must treat Supabase as an infrastructure layer, not as a
replacement for domain boundaries.

## 2. Supabase Components

```text
Supabase
├── Auth
├── PostgreSQL
├── Storage
├── Realtime
└── RLS
```

## 3. Authentication

Use Supabase Auth for:

- Email/password registration.
- Login.
- Logout.
- Password recovery.
- Password reset.
- Session management.

The frontend must never implement its own authentication system.

### 3.1 Auth implementation

The auth module lives in `src/features/auth/` and follows these decisions:

- Credentials are submitted through Server Actions and validated on both the
  client (inline feedback) and the server (source of truth).
- Supabase sessions are refreshed in `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 replaced
  `middleware.ts` with `proxy.ts`). Protected pages also call `requireUser`
  on the server, so route protection never depends only on the proxy.
- E-mail confirmation and password recovery links land on
  `/auth/callback`, which exchanges the PKCE code for a session.
- Registration sends `display_name` as user metadata. The `profiles` table
  remains owned by the `profile` module.
- Password reset requires the temporary session created by the recovery
  link; without it, the reset page shows an expired-link state.

Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration must include:

```text
Site URL:      <NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL>
Redirect URLs: <NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL>/auth/callback
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is optional in local development; when it is not
set, the request host is used to build the redirect links.

## 4. Profiles

Supabase Auth manages authentication identities.

Application-specific user information belongs in:

```text
profiles
```

Suggested fields:

```text
id
display_name
avatar_path
phone
location
created_at
updated_at
```

The profile ID should reference the authenticated user's ID.

## 5. Database Entities

Initial database entities:

```text
profiles
categories
products
product_images
favorites
conversations
conversation_participants
messages
reports
notifications
```

Do not create all entities before the corresponding feature requires
them.

## 6. Products

Implemented in `migrations/0003_products.sql` as the public read domain.
Listing creation and seller mutations belong to the `listings` module.

```text
products
├── id
├── seller_id          → profiles(id)
├── category_id        → categories(id)
├── title
├── description
├── price              numeric(12, 2)
├── condition          new | like_new | excellent | good
├── city
├── neighborhood       nullable
├── status             draft | active | paused | sold | removed
├── created_at
└── updated_at
```

`city` and `neighborhood` are stored separately; the UI renders
`City - Neighborhood`. Contact phone/e-mail are intentionally not part of the
public read model — contact happens through chat.

`categories` holds the reference data (`slug`, `name`, `sort_order`) and is
publicly readable. `category_listing_counts` is a `security_invoker` view that
exposes active product counts per category, so the catalog never fetches every
product to render a badge.

## 7. Product Status

```text
draft
active
paused
sold
removed
```

Only `active` products appear in the public marketplace. Public queries always
filter by `status = 'active'`; RLS enforces the same rule server-side, so the
status sent by a client is never trusted.

## 8. Product Images

Use:

```text
product_images
├── id
├── product_id         → products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
├── storage_path
├── alt_text
├── sort_order
├── is_primary
└── created_at
```

Images live in the public `product-images` bucket. Uploads are restricted to
the seller's own folder (`<auth.uid()>/...`); reads are public because the
catalog is public. A partial unique index guarantees at most one primary image
per product.

### Applying the products schema

```bash
# Apply the schema with the Supabase SQL editor or psql.
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f migrations/0003_products.sql

# Development seed (requires at least one profile).
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f seeds/0001_products.sql
```

The seed is idempotent and attaches demo listings to the oldest profile. It
uses local images under `public/products/` so the catalog works without
uploading files to Storage.

## 9. Storage

Initial storage areas:

```text
product-images
avatars
chat-images
```

### Product Images

Used by public listings.

### Avatars

Used by profiles and seller information.

### Chat Images

Must be protected according to conversation membership.

Do not make private chat images publicly accessible by default.

## 10. Row Level Security

RLS is mandatory.

The frontend must never be considered the final authorization layer.

### Profiles

Users can update their own profile.

Users should only access profile fields intended to be public.

### Products

Public users can read active products.

Authenticated users can create products.

Users can update and delete only products where:

```text
products.seller_id = auth.uid()
```

### Favorites

Users can only create, read, and delete their own favorites.

### Conversations

Users can only access conversations where they are participants.

### Messages

Users can only access messages belonging to conversations in which they
participate.

## 11. Realtime

Supabase Realtime should be used for:

### Chat

- New messages.
- Message updates.
- Read status.

### Presence

- Online/offline state.

### Typing

Typing indicators can use realtime presence/broadcast mechanisms rather
than persistent database records.

Do not persist transient typing state unless there is a clear
requirement.

## 12. Conversation Model

A conversation should have a product context.

Conceptually:

```text
products
   │
   ▼
conversations
   │
   ├── buyer
   ├── seller
   │
   ▼
messages
```

Suggested entities:

```text
conversations
conversation_participants
messages
```

A conversation should not exist independently from its product context
in the MVP.

## 13. Message Model

Suggested fields:

```text
messages
├── id
├── conversation_id
├── sender_id
├── message_type
├── content
├── attachment_path
├── created_at
└── read_at
```

Possible message types:

```text
text
image
```

Additional types can be added later.

## 14. File Upload Security

Validate uploads before storing them.

Consider:

- MIME type.
- File extension.
- Maximum size.
- Image dimensions.
- Upload ownership.
- Storage policy.

Never trust a file extension supplied by the client.

## 15. Database Access Pattern

Avoid putting large Supabase queries directly inside UI components.

Preferred:

```text
Component
    ↓
Hook / Server Action
    ↓
Feature Service
    ↓
Supabase
```

Example:

```text
ProductPage
    ↓
useProduct()
    ↓
products.service.ts
    ↓
Supabase
```

## 16. Server and Browser Clients

Use the correct Supabase client depending on execution context.

Browser interactions should use the browser-safe client.

Server-side operations should use the server-compatible client.

The Supabase service-role key must never be exposed to browser code.

## 17. Environment Variables

Only public configuration may use client-exposed variables.

Never expose:

```text
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

to the browser.

Environment configuration should be centralized and validated.

## 18. Migrations

All schema changes must be versioned.

Use migrations for:

- Tables.
- Columns.
- Indexes.
- Constraints.
- RLS policies.
- Functions.
- Triggers.

Never depend on undocumented manual dashboard changes for
application-critical schema.

## 19. Indexing

Add indexes based on real query patterns.

Likely candidates include:

```text
products.status
products.category_id
products.seller_id
products.created_at
favorites.user_id
messages.conversation_id
messages.created_at
conversation_participants.user_id
```

Do not add indexes blindly.

Review query plans as the dataset grows.

## 20. Search

The initial implementation can use PostgreSQL capabilities appropriate
to the MVP.

Search should support:

- Product title.
- Description where appropriate.
- Category.
- Price.
- Location.

Search parameters should preferably be represented in the URL.

Example:

```text
/products?q=iphone&category=electronics&sort=recent
```

For larger datasets, evaluate PostgreSQL full-text search or a dedicated
search solution.

## 21. Pagination

Never fetch the entire marketplace dataset.

Use pagination or another bounded query strategy.

Product listings should have:

- Explicit page size.
- Stable ordering.
- Appropriate indexes.

## 22. Realtime Subscription Rules

Realtime subscriptions must be scoped narrowly.

Do not subscribe an entire application to all messages.

Example:

```text
Current conversation
        ↓
Subscribe only to relevant events
```

Unsubscribe when the component or route no longer requires the
subscription.

## 23. Security Checklist

Before considering Supabase integration complete:

```text
[ ] Auth configured
[ ] Profiles protected
[ ] Product RLS configured
[ ] Listing ownership enforced
[ ] Favorites protected
[ ] Conversations protected
[ ] Messages protected
[ ] Storage policies configured
[ ] Chat images protected
[ ] Service role key not exposed
[ ] Upload validation implemented
[ ] Database migrations versioned
[ ] Sensitive fields reviewed
```

## 24. Development Order

Supabase implementation should follow the application phases:

```text
Foundation
    ↓
Auth
    ↓
Profiles
    ↓
Products
    ↓
Listings
    ↓
Favorites
    ↓
Chat
    ↓
Notifications
    ↓
Security hardening
```

Do not build the entire database schema before implementing the
corresponding modules.

## 25. Guiding Principle

Supabase should provide reliable infrastructure while the application
retains clear domain boundaries.

The frontend should not become a collection of arbitrary Supabase
queries.

Database access, authorization, storage and realtime behavior must
remain understandable, testable and aligned with the feature/module
architecture.
