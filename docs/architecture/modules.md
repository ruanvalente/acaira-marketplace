# Ver-o-Preço --- Modules Architecture

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the responsibilities and boundaries of the Ver-o-Preço
application modules.

The project follows a **feature/module-first architecture**.

Each module should own its business logic and domain-specific UI.

## 2. Core Modules

```text
auth
profile
products
listings
favorites
chat
dashboard
```

## 3. Auth Module

Path:

```text
src/features/auth/
```

### Responsibilities

- User registration.
- Login.
- Logout.
- Password recovery.
- Password reset.
- Session handling.
- Authentication state.
- Protected route behavior.

### Does Not Own

- Product authorization.
- Listing ownership.
- Chat permissions.

Those rules belong to their respective domains and backend policies.

### Suggested Structure

```text
auth/
├── components/
├── hooks/
├── services/
├── schemas/
├── types/
└── tests/
```

## 4. Profile Module

```

### Responsibilities

- Public product catalog.

This must be enforced by Supabase RLS.

### Suggested Components

```text
ListingForm
ListingImageUploader
ListingImageGrid
ListingPreview
ListingStatusBadge
MyListingCard
```

## 7. Favorites Module

Path:

```text
src/features/favorites/
```

### Responsibilities

### Suggested Structure

```text
chat/
├── components/
│   ├── chat-window/
│   ├── conversation-list/
│   ├── conversation-item/
│   ├── message-list/
│   ├── message-bubble/
│   ├── message-input/
│   ├── image-message/
│   └── typing-indicator/
├── hooks/
├── services/
├── schemas/
├── types/
└── tests/
```

### Important Rule

A conversation should be associated with a product.

The chat exists primarily to allow buyers and sellers to discuss a
listing.

## 9. Dashboard Module

Path:

```text
src/features/dashboard/
```

### Responsibilities

- Dashboard overview.
- Listing summary.
- Basic metrics.
- Recent listings.
- Recent conversations.
- Quick actions.

The dashboard should compose other modules rather than duplicate their
business logic.

For example:

```text
Dashboard
 ├── ListingsSummary → Listings module
 ├── RecentMessages → Chat module
 └── FavoritesSummary → Favorites module
```

## 10. Module Dependency Rules

Prefer dependencies in this direction:

```text
App Routes
    ↓
Features
    ↓
Infrastructure
```

Features may consume shared UI primitives.

Avoid direct feature-to-feature coupling when possible.

Example:

The product details page may trigger a chat action, but the Products
module should not contain Chat business logic.

Prefer an explicit integration boundary:

```text
Products
    │
    └── StartConversation
              │
              ▼
           Chat
```

## 11. Shared Components

Global components belong to:

```text
src/components/ui/
```

Only generic components should live there.

Examples:

- Button.
- Input.
- Dialog.
- Drawer.
- Card.
- Badge.
- Avatar.
- Skeleton.
- Toast.

Feature-specific components stay inside their feature.

Incorrect:

```text
src/components/ui/ProductCard.tsx
```

Preferred:

```text
src/features/products/components/ProductCard.tsx
```

## 12. Shared Hooks

Do not create a global hooks directory by default.

If a hook belongs to a feature:

```text
features/products/hooks/
```

Only genuinely cross-cutting hooks should be promoted to:

```text
src/hooks/
```

## 13. Shared Types

Avoid creating a giant global type file.

Prefer:

```text
features/products/types/
features/chat/types/
features/listings/types/
```

Global types should be reserved for types that truly cross multiple
domains.

## 14. Module Development Lifecycle

Every new module should follow:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Domain definition
    ↓
Data model
    ↓
Authorization
    ↓
UI states
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Tests
    ↓
Integration
```

## 15. Future Modules

Possible future modules:

```text
reviews/
payments/
orders/
shipping/
notifications/
moderation/
reports/
analytics/
recommendations/
admin/
subscriptions/
```

Future modules should be introduced independently instead of adding
unrelated logic to existing modules.
